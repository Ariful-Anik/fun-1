          <h1>Enlarged breasts in men (gynecomastia)</h1>
          <p>
            Gynecomastia (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh) is an increase in the amount
            of breast gland tissue in boys or men. An imbalance of the hormones
            estrogen and testosterone causes it. Gynecomastia can affect one or
            both breasts, sometimes unevenly. Pseudogynecomastia is an increase
            in fat but not gland tissue in male breasts. Newborns, boys going
            through puberty and older men may develop gynecomastia due to
            natural changes in hormone levels. There are other causes too. Most
            often, gynecomastia isn't a serious problem. But it can be tough to
            cope with the condition. People with gynecomastia sometimes have
            pain in their breasts. And they may feel embarrassed. Gynecomastia
            may go away on its own. If it doesn't, medicine or surgery may help.
          </p>
          <h3>Causes</h3>
          <p>
            In people assigned male at birth, the body mainly makes the sex
            hormone testosterone. It also makes small amounts of the hormone
            estrogen. Gynecomastia can happen when the amount of testosterone in
            the body drops compared with estrogen. The decrease can be caused by
            conditions that lower testosterone or block its effects. Or it can
            be caused by conditions that raise the estrogen level. Some things
            that can change the body's hormone balance include the following:
            Natural hormone changes The hormones testosterone and estrogen
            control sex traits. Testosterone controls traits such as muscle mass
            and body hair. Estrogen controls traits that include the growth of
            breasts. Estrogen levels that are too high or are out of balance
            with testosterone levels can cause gynecomastia. Gynecomastia in
            infants. More than half of male babies are born with enlarged
            breasts due to the effects of estrogen during pregnancy. The swollen
            breast tissue usually goes away within 2 to 3 weeks after birth.
            Gynecomastia during puberty. Gynecomastia caused by hormone changes
            during puberty is somewhat common. Most of the time, the swollen
            breast tissue goes away without treatment within 6 months to 2
            years. Gynecomastia in adults. About 24% to 65% of men ages 50 to 80
            get gynecomastia. But most adults with the condition have no
            symptoms.
          </p>
          <h3>Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            The following medicines can cause gynecomastia: Anti-androgens used
            to treat conditions such as an enlarged prostate and prostate
            cancer. Examples of these medicines include flutamide, finasteride
            (Proscar, Propecia) and spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir).
            Anabolic steroids and androgens to treat delayed puberty or muscle
            loss from another disease. Antiretroviral medicines. The
            estrogen-like properties of some HIV medicines can cause
            gynecomastia, especially efavirenz. ADHD medicines that contain
            amphetamines, such as Adderall. Anti-anxiety medications, such as
            diazepam (Valium). Tricyclic antidepressants. Some antibiotics.
            Opioids to treat chronic pain. Ulcer medicines, such as the
            nonprescription medicines cimetidine (Tagamet HB) and omeprazole
            (Prilosec). Chemotherapy to treat cancer. Heart medicines, such as
            digoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers. Stomach-emptying
            medicines, such as metoclopramide.

          <h1>A more detailed (Gynecomastia)</h1>
          <p>
            Gynecomastia is a condition where boys or men experience an increase
            in breast gland tissue. This occurs due to an imbalance between the
            hormones estrogen and testosterone. It can affect one or both
            breasts and sometimes appears unevenly. A related condition,
            pseudogynecomastia, involves an increase in fat rather than
            glandular tissue in the male breasts. Common Demographics: Newborns:
            Many male infants are born with enlarged breasts due to maternal
            estrogen, typically resolving within a few weeks. Puberty: Hormonal
            changes during puberty can cause temporary gynecomastia, often
            resolving within 6 months to 2 years. Older Men: Hormonal changes in
            aging men, particularly between ages 50 to 80, can lead to
            gynecomastia. Symptoms: Enlargement of breast tissue, which can
            cause pain or tenderness. Emotional distress or embarrassment due to
            physical appearance.
          </p>
          <h3>Causes</h3>
          <p>
            Natural Hormone Changes: The bodyâ€™s balance of testosterone and
            estrogen can be disrupted by various life stages and conditions.
            Testosterone controls male traits like muscle mass, while estrogen
            can stimulate breast tissue growth. Infants and Puberty: High
            estrogen levels from the mother can cause gynecomastia in infants,
            while puberty-related hormone changes can affect boys. Adults: A
            significant number of older men experience gynecomastia due to
            shifting hormone levels. Medications: Certain medications can
            disrupt hormonal balance, leading to gynecomastia. These include:
            Anti-androgens: Used for prostate issues, such as flutamide and
            finasteride. Anabolic Steroids and Androgens: Used for delayed
            puberty or muscle wasting. Antiretrovirals: Some HIV treatments,
            notably efavirenz, have estrogen-like effects. ADHD Medications:
            Containing amphetamines, like Adderall. Anti-anxiety and
            Antidepressants: Including diazepam and tricyclic antidepressants.
            Antibiotics: Certain antibiotics can affect hormone levels. Opioids:
            For chronic pain management. Ulcer Medications: Such as cimetidine
            and omeprazole. Chemotherapy: Cancer treatments can affect hormone
            production. Heart Medications: Such as digoxin and calcium channel
            blockers. Gastrointestinal Medications: Metoclopramide used for
            stomach emptying issues.
          </p>
          <h3>Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            Gynecomastia may resolve on its own without intervention. If
            persistent, treatments include medications to adjust hormone levels
            or surgical options to remove excess tissue. New Information:
            Diagnosis: Physical examination, medical history review, and tests
            such as blood tests, mammograms, or biopsies may be conducted to
            diagnose gynecomastia. Lifestyle Changes: Weight loss and exercise
            can help reduce fatty tissue in pseudogynecomastia. Psychological
            Support: Counseling or support groups may benefit those struggling
            with the emotional aspects of gynecomastia. For more detailed and
            personalized advice, consulting a healthcare provider is
            recommended.
